# lld-design-patterns

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
To explore the design patterns implemented in this repository, **[go to the `patterns` folder](./patterns/)**.

This folder contains a collection of classic design patterns, each with a clear example implemented in JavaScript.  
Browse the list below to jump directly to a pattern and see its code in action:

## Patterns


- [Factory](./patterns/Factory.js) â€“ Create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- [Strategy](./patterns/Strategy.js) â€“ Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- [Decorator](./patterns/Decorator.js) â€“ Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

> Each pattern above links to a JavaScript example for easy reference.
